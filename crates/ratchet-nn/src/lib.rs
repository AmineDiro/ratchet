/// #Â Module
///
/// Analagous to `torch.nn.Module` in PyTorch, a `Module` is a trait that represents a neural network
/// module. However, it has 1 key difference.
///
/// In PyTorch, `forward` performs the computation when called. In Ratchet, `schedule` is used to
/// schedule the computation for future execution. The Tensor returned is lazy, in that it
/// represents the result of the computation, but the computation itself has not been performed.

/// Ditto above, but can mutate self.
