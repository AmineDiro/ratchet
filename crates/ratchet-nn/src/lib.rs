/// #Â Module
///
/// Analagous to `torch.nn.Module` in PyTorch, a `Module` is a trait that represents a neural network
/// module. However, it has 1 key difference.
///
/// In PyTorch, `forward` performs the computation when called. In Ratchet, `schedule` is used to
/// schedule the computation for future execution. The Tensor returned is lazy, in that it
/// represents the result of the computation, but the computation itself has not been performed.
///
/// If you want to immediately access the result of the computation (say for debugging), call
/// `.resolve()` on the Tensor to execute the work.
pub trait Module {
    type Input;
    fn schedule(&self, input: Self::Input) -> anyhow::Result<Tensor>;

/// # MutableModule
///
/// Ditto above, but can mutate self.
